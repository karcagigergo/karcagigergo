### âš¡ About karcagigergo

I consider myself as a global citizen but I was born and educated in Hungary. I lived and worked in London - UK, from where I traveled a lot around the globe. I guess London made me like to travel and discover new places, expanding my knowledge about the world. This mindset has taken me to Brasil where I currently live.
